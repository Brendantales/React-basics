        <p>
          I am Brendan. I used to play pokemon planet, I was very good at it. But
          I quit the game since I felt that the game is hindering my progress in
          other aspects which are very necessary in my life.

        <p>Below are top 3 vacation spots I would love to visit: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>1. Mountain top, maybe hiking</li>
          <li>2. Beach without too much crowd, just to enjoy the breeze</li>
          <li>3. An Oasis, maybe if the life permits</li>
        </ul>
